// A JQL query clause that consists of nested clauses. For example, `(labels in (urgent, blocker) OR lastCommentedBy = currentUser()). Note that, where nesting is not defined, the parser nests JQL clauses based on the operator precedence. For example, \"A OR B AND C\" is parsed as \"(A OR B) AND C\". See Setting the precedence of operators for more information about precedence in JQL queries.`
